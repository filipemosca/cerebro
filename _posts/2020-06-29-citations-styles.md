### Reports:

The format for reference to reports is similar to books but with addition of the standard or report number.

### Web addresses: 

References to websites can be a simple reference in the text only, such as ‘(see www.bnfl.org.uk)’. However, if they refer to a specific written work on a web page or in a downloadable web file, they should be given as a full reference together with the date it was last accessed, for example:

HA (Highways Agency) (2009) Act on CO2 Calculator. HA, London, UK. See https://carboncalculator.direct.gov.uk/index.html (accessed 27/06/2011).

### Legislation: 

References to national legislation and European directives should take the following form:

Traffic Management Act 2004 (2004) Elizabeth II. Chapter 18. Her Majesty’s Stationery Office, London, UK
