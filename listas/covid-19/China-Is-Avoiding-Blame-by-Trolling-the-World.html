<p>This
is what allowed the virus to spread across the globe. Because the 
Chinese Communist Party was pretending that there was little to be 
concerned about, Wuhan was a porous purveyor of the virus. The 
government only instituted a lockdown in Wuhan on January 23—seven weeks
 after the virus first appeared. As events in Italy, the United States, 
Spain, and France have shown, quite a lot can happen in a week, much 
less seven. By then, mayor Zhou Xianwang admitted that more than <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-urges-calm-over-virus-during-critical-period-11580045718" data-omni-click="r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'5',r'None'">5 million people</a> had already left Wuhan.</p><p>If that weren’t enough, we can plumb recent history for an even more damning account. In a 2019 article, Chinese experts <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/11/3/210" data-omni-click="r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'6',r'None'">warned</a>
 it was “highly likely that future SARS- or MERS-like coronavirus 
outbreaks will originate from bats, and there is an increased 
probability that this will occur in China.” In a 2007 journal article, 
infectious-disease specialists published a study <a href="https://cmr.asm.org/content/cmr/20/4/660.full.pdf" data-omni-click="r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'7',r'None'">arguing</a>
 that “the presence of a large reservoir of SARS-CoV-like viruses in 
horseshoe bats, together with the culture of eating exotic mammals in 
southern China, is a time bomb. The possibility of the reemergence of 
SARS and other novel viruses from animals or laboratories and therefore 
the need for preparedness should not be ignored.” It was ignored.</p><p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" id="injected-recirculation-link-1"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/coronavirus-showed-america-wasnt-task/608023/" data-omni-click="r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'8',r'None'">Anne Applebaum: The coronavirus called America’s bluff</a></p><p>The
 political scientist Andrew Michta has drawn controversy and accusations
 of racism for stating what any measured overview of the evidence makes 
clear. “The question about assigning agency and blame is pretty 
straightforward to answer,” he <a href="https://www.the-american-interest.com/2020/03/17/the-wuhan-virus-and-the-imperative-of-hard-decoupling/" data-omni-click="r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'9',r'None'">writes</a> in <em>The American Interest</em>. The Chinese state, he says, is culpable.</p><p>But
 is this a time for blame? Yes, it is. Accounting for responsibility 
when a disaster happens—particularly one likely to devastate entire 
countries, leaving thousands dead—is not beside the point, particularly 
as Chinese officials move to take advantage of the crisis and launch a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/world/asia/coronavirus-china-conspiracy-theory.html" data-omni-click="r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'10',r'None'">disinformation campaign</a> claiming that the U.S. Army introduced the virus.</p><p>Well before the new coronavirus spread across American cities, the Chinese regime was already rather creatively <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/banished-in-beijing-11582157934" data-omni-click="r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'11',r'None'">trolling U.S. publications</a>, expelling American journalists, and “<a href="https://soundcloud.com/the-wisdom-of-crowds/episode-11-the-weaponization-of-wokeness" data-omni-click="r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'12',r'None'">weaponizing wokeness</a>” over anything it perceived as critical of China’s role in mishandling the epidemic. To hear Chinese spokespeople <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/trump-calls-covid-19-the-chinese-virus-as-rift-with-coronavirus-beijing-escalates" data-omni-click="r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'13',r'None'">use the language of racism and prejudice</a>
 is somewhat surreal, considering this is a regime that has put more 
than 1 million Muslims and ethnic minorities in “reeducation” camps.</p><p>Of
 course, Americans will have to be vigilant against scapegoating Asians 
in general or the Chinese people in particular. With one of the highest 
infection rates and death tolls, Chinese citizens have suffered enough. 
The Chinese leadership, however, is another matter. A government is not a
 race. It’s a regime—and easily one of the worst and most brutal in our 
lifetime. Criticizing authoritarian regimes for what they do outside 
their own borders and to their own people is simply calling things as 
they are. To do otherwise is to forgo analysis and accuracy in the name 
of assuaging a regime that deserves no such consideration.</p>
